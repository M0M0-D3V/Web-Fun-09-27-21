    Welcome Ninjas!
    
    I am excited that you are starting on your journey in this awesome world of coding! I am here not only to teach, but to support and encourage you the best I can so you can be successful. 🌱
    
    You may have some varying emotions from excitement to being terrified, and that is okay! I see you.
    
    I am there with excitement for those 💡lightbulb💡 moments you are going to have when something works for the first time.
    
    I am also there with you with how hard and intense it is going to be, because I have gone through the bootcamp myself.
    
    And I have good news! You will get through this 💪🏻 and I believe in ✨you✨.
    
    I'm excited the next 4 weeks are going to be an adventure together! 🎢
    
    I promise to answer any questions you may have about what we're programming and to be upfront with you so you are not surprised with anything.
    
    I only ask that you come with a curiosity to dive in with me and do what is necessary to stay on course each week.
    
    Welcome again and best of luck!
    
    --Monica Hong🥰
